Below is a step-by-step pseudo code explanation for the provided 
Python quiz project, along with the concepts used in each step:

1. Welcome Message and Play Confirmation:
Display a welcome message to the user.
Ask the user if they want to play the quiz.
Use the input() function to receive user input.

2. Input Validation and Quitting:
Convert the user's input to lowercase using the lower() method for case-insensitivity.
Check if the user's input is not equal to "yes." If so, quit the program using the quit() function.

3. Starting the Quiz:
If the user chooses to play ("yes"), display a confirmation message and initialize a variable score to keep track of correct answers.

4. Asking Quiz Questions:
Use the input() function to ask questions one by one and receive the user's answers.
Compare the user's answers with the correct answers using conditional statements (if, else).
Increment the score variable for each correct answer.

5. Scoring and Feedback:
After all questions are answered, display the total number of correct answers (score) and calculate the percentage.
Use string concatenation and conversion to display the score and percentage.

Concepts Used:

1. Input/Output: Using input() to get user input and print() to display messages.
2. String Comparison: Checking user answers using conditional statements 
    (if, else) and string comparison.
3. Variable Manipulation: Using variables (score, answer) to track 
    and manage data during the program execution.
4. Looping (not explicitly shown): The code logic is repeated for each quiz question, 
    demonstrating the concept of repetition in programming.
5. String Formatting: Using string concatenation (+) and placeholders ({}) 
    for displaying formatted output.
