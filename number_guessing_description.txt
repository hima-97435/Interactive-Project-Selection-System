Sure, here is a step-by-step explanation for the provided Python number guessing game project, along with the concepts used in each step:

1. Importing Required Module:
The random module is imported at the beginning of the program. This module is used to generate random numbers which are used to randomly select the target number.

2. Setting the Range:
The user is asked to enter the upper limit for the range of possible numbers. The input() function is used to receive user input.

3. Input Validation:
The isdigit() method is used to check if the user's input is a number. If it's not, a message is displayed and the program is terminated using the quit() function. If the input is a number but less than or equal to 0, a message is displayed and the program is also terminated.

4. Generating the Target Number:
A random number between 0 and the user's input is generated and stored in the variable `random_number`.

5. Initializing the Guess Counter:
A variable `guesses` is initialized to keep track of the number of guesses the user makes.

6. Guessing Loop:
A while loop is used to continuously ask the user for their guess until they guess the correct number. Inside this loop, the guessing logic is implemented.

7. User Guess:
The user is asked to enter their guess. The input is checked to ensure it's a number. If it's not, a message is displayed and the loop continues to the next iteration.

8. Checking the Guess:
The user's guess is compared with the target number. If the guess is correct, a success message is displayed and the loop is broken. If the guess is too high or too low, a hint is displayed.

9. Displaying the Result:
After the user guesses the correct number, the total number of guesses is displayed.

Concepts Used:

1. Random Number Generation: The random module is used to generate random numbers.
2. Loops: A while loop is used to continuously run the game.
3. Conditional Statements: if and else statements are used to implement the game logic.
4. User Input: The input() function is used to get the user's guess.
5. String Manipulation: The isdigit() method is used to check if the user's input is a number.
6. Variable Manipulation: Variables are used to keep track of the target number and the number of guesses.
7. Output: The print() function is used to display messages to the user.
